# middleman-sushiplate

A [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) template boilerplate with SCSS,
modular, HTML5 sushi flavor. No frills, no grids, no UI elements. Just the basics.

## WUT? No Twitter Bootstrap?

This is the base structure I generally use on projects, with separate folders
and files to allow easy modular interface development, SMACSSS, OOCSS, and all
those other pretty acronyms; lean, HTML5 Boilerplate-based layout; and some
useful helpers and mixins I've developed and collected across the Interwebz.

The sushiplate mindset is: start raw, make it your own. Develop your own grid,
UI elements, or add external ones as needed.

## Usage

1. Clone this repo: `git clone git://github.com/eshiota/middleman-sushiplate.git ~/.middleman/sushiplate`
2. Install middleman: `gem install middleman`
3. Create your middleman project with the sushiplate template: `middleman init my_project --template=sushiplate`
